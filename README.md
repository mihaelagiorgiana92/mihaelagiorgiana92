Hi, I am Mihaela!
Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you can find the link to my online resume, which showcases my skills, experiences, and projects as I continue my journey into web development.

## About me
Born in Romania and raised in Italy, I call Walsall, West Midlands, home. I'm passionate about learning and currently exploring web development with HTML, CSS, Python, MySQL and JavaScript. I love a good horror book that keeps me on the edge of my seat, but I also enjoy spending time outdoors, finding adventure and inspiration. For me, web development is the perfect mix of creativity and exploration, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me!
